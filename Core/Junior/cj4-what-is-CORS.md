### What is CORS?
**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** - is a rule that forbids the exchange of data between different resources unless otherwise specified. For example, *mywebsite.com* can't request data from *anotherwebsite.com*. The result will be - CORS forbidden. To change this behavior, *anotherwebsite.com* should send to *mywebsite.com* in its response an *Access-Control-Allow-Origin* HEADER parameter set to \* (resource can be accessed by all hosts) or *mywebsite.com* (resource can be accessed by *mywebsite.com*).

> Each request has an *Origin* parameter in its header. So when the Origin of the server and the Origin of the request are the same, CORS is not activated. When *mywebsite.com* sends a request to the server, the request will contain the *Origin: mywebsite.com* parameter.
