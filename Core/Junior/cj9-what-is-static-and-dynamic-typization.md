### What is static and dynamic typing?
*JavaScript* is a dynamically typed language, which means that types are assigned while the code is being executed. *TypeScript*, on the other hand, is a statically typed language, where types are assigned before the code is executed. *TypeScript* is compiled into *.js* files, which are then interpreted by the browser.
